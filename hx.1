.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a hex editor made for today's virtual terminals. It
uses vim-inspired key bindings to navigate and edit the binary contents
of a file.

The options included with the program are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl g Ar grouping
specifies the grouping of bytes.
.It Fl o Ar octet_length
amount of octets to display per line.
.It Fl h
displays help and exits.
.It Fl v
displays version info and exits.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Open the hx binary in hex view, with default grouping of 4 bytes, and 16 octets per line.

.Sh KEY BINDINGS
To navigate in the editor, the following key bindings are made available:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact -offset 2n
.It
CTRL+Q:    : quit immediately without saving.
.It
CTRL+S     : save file in-place.
.It
h / left   : move cursor one byte left in the buffer.
.It
l / right  : move cursor one byte right in the buffer.
.It
j / down   : move cursor one position up (= num_octets_per_line).
.It
k / up     : move cursor one position down (= num_octets_per_line).
.It
]          : increment the byte at the cursor position with 1.
.It
[          : decrement the byte at the cursor position with 1.
.It
x / DEL    : delete byte at current cursor position.
.It
/          : start search input.
.It
n          : search for next occurrence.
.It
N          : search for previous occurrence.
.It
u          : undo the last action, until the undo stack is empty.
.It
CTRL+R     : redo the last undone action, until there is nothing left to redo.
.It
a          : enable APPEND mode.
.It
A          : enable APPEND-ASCII mode.
.It
i          : enable INSERT mode.
.It
I          : enable INSERT-ASCII mode.
.It
r          : enable REPLACE mode.
.It
ESC        : enable NORMAL mode.
.It
:          : enable COMMAND mode. See section
.Em COMMAND MODE
for more information.

.Sh MODES
.Nm
knows of five several modes which can be used.
.Ss NORMAL
Normal-mode is the mode where regular keys can be used to switch modes, navigate
through the buffer, etc. Hit ESC at any time to trigger normal-mode.
.Ss APPEND
In append-mode, the editor appends a byte value one position after the current
selected offset. To go into append mode, type 'a' when in normal-mode. Two valid
hexadecimal characters need to be typed to append that byte value. For instance,
type '6' followed by '5' to append the hex value '0x65' (which is ASCII 'e').
.Ss APPEND-ASCII
Same as the APPEND mode, except everything that is typed on the keyboard will be
appended.
.Ss INSERT
In insert-mode, the editor inserts a byte value at the current offset. Use 'i'
when in normal-mode to switch to insert-mode.
.Ss INSERT-ASCII
Same as the INSERT mode, except everything that is typed on the keyboard will be
inserted.
.Ss REPLACE
In replace-mode, the editor replaces the current byte at the current offset with
a byte of choice. Use 'r' when in normal-mode to switch to replace-mode.
.Ss COMMAND
In command-mode, manual commands can be entered. This can be triggered by typing
the colon (
.Sy :
) character. The cursor will move to the bottom where there's space to type
a command. Current implemented commands are:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact -offset 2n
.It
NUM               go to offset in base 10. For example, ':455' will go to offset '0x1c7'.
.It
0xHEXVALUE        go to offset in base 16. For example, ':0x1c7' will go to offset '455'.
.It
set o=NUM         set octets per line to NUM
.It
set octets=NUM    idem
.It
set g=NUM         set byte grouping to NUM
.It
set grouping=NUM  idem
.It
w                 write buffer to disk
.It
q                 quit (add ! to force quit)

.Sh BUGS
May very well be there. Pull requests and/or patches are welcome in any way.

.Nm
has not been tested well with huge files, so performance problems
may apply. Currently, a whole file is read into memory, meaning you are tied
to the amount of memory you currently have available. I developed the program
to alter binary executables, so really large files haven't been a problem for
me, yet.

.Nm
also does not use a library such as (n)curses to manipulate the terminal
screen, and relies solely on ANSI escape sequences. Therefore portability
may be an issue, but should work well on most modern terminal emulators.
